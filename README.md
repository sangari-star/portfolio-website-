## My portfolio website

This is a basic personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It features a clean and responsive layout designed to showcase my work, introduce myself, and provide a way for visitors to get in touch. The website consists of two main pages:

## Home Page:
The Home page includes a brief introduction, a profile image or banner, and a section highlighting my skills or featured projects. The layout is structured using semantic HTML elements with custom CSS for styling, ensuring readability and visual appeal.

## Contact Page:
The Contact page provides a simple contact form where visitors can enter their name, email, and message. It also includes my contact details such as email address or social media links. The form is styled using CSS to match the overall theme of the site.
